# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
I think that .match combined with replace allows the regex to search through the given text and replace all instances of whatever conditions you put into .match with what you want to see.

1/3. The `/g` flag allows you to find/alter all instances, no matter if we're matching or replacing!
